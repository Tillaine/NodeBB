# NodeBB

This repo holds the basic file structure for a theme. 

I attempted to update the theme by creating a new template, but that made the admin interface unusable. 

If I were to do this challenge again, I would create the theme, as I have done, and then adjust things with the UI instead of directly changing the templates. 

I did not update the button because the interface became unusable. I dropped all associated databases and caches, then I rebuilt all packages, but it was still rendering old uninstalled templates that made the UI unusable. There is no way for me to use the intended interface because of the old template. After troubleshooting for over an hour, I pushed my code.
